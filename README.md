# DShop 

## Getting Started without Docker

1. Clone the repository with `git clone "repository link"`
2. Enter the share_core folder (MFE) and run `npm install` if the dependencies aren't installed. Then run the command `npm run start`.
3. Enter the share_angular folder (MFE) and run `npm install` if the dependencies aren't installed. Then run the command `npm run start`.
4. Enter the share_react folder (MFE) and run `npm install` if the dependencies aren't installed. Then run the command `npm run start`.
5. Enter the product_detail folder (MFE) and run `npm install` if the dependencies aren't installed. Then run the command `npm run start`.
6. Enter the home folder (MFE) and run `npm install` if the dependencies aren't installed. Then run the command `npm run start`.
7. Enter the container folder (MFE) and run `npm install` if the dependencies aren't installed. Then run the command `npm run start`.

## Getting Started with Docker

1. Clone the repository with `git clone "repository link"`
2. Join to `shared_core`, `shared_angular`, `shared_react`, `product_detail`, `home` and `container` folders (MFEs) and execute: `npm install` or `yarn install` in the terminal.
3. Go to the previous folder and execute: `docker-compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml build --no-cache` in the terminal
4. Once built, you must execute the command: `docker-compose -f dev.docker-compose.yml up --force-recreate` in the terminal

NOTE: You have to be standing in the folder containing the: `dev.docker-compose.yml` and you need to install `Docker Desktop` if you are in Windows.

## Description

This project is a fun project that allowed me to learn `MicroFrontends (MFEs)` with the `ModuleFederationPlugin`. We basically have six Microfrontends, one of which serves as the orchestrator for the rest, i.e., the `container` MFE.

1. **Container - REACT JS**: The MFE Container is responsible for displaying the final result, as well as rendering the Home and Product detail pages, as well as various components.
2. **Home - REACT JS**: The Home MFE is responsible for rendering the website's main home page. It receives the information to be rendered through props and also consumes components from other MFEs.
3. **Product Detail - VUE 3**: The Product Detail MFE is responsible for rendering a specific product page on the website. It behaves similarly to the Home MFE, receiving the information to be rendered in props and also consuming components from other MFEs.
4. **Shared React - REACT JS**: The Shared React MFE is an MFE that only consumes `Shared Core MFE` and is used to develop React-based components.
5. **Shared Angular - ANGULAR 14**: The Shared Angular MFE is an MFE that only consumes `Shared Core MFE` and is used to develop Angular-based components.
6. **Shared Core - REACT JS**: The Shared Core MFE doesn't consume any MFE. It's only responsible for exposing basic components for reuse in other MFEs, such as buttons, SVGs, cards, etc.

## Technologies used
